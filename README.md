## Static Website Hosting Using AWS

This project shows how to effectively use Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront to deploy and serve a static website.
It was finished as a component of the Accenture Primers Cloud Project, which sought to provide practical experience in the deployment of websites using AWS services.

## Deployed URLs

•	S3 Website Endpoint:
🔗 http://my-4125-7023-6352-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

•	CloudFront Distribution URL:
🔗 http://d2p9og5esonrzt.cloudfront.net
Both links lead to the live version of the website hosted on AWS.

## This process gave me a lot of hands-on experience with different AWS services. 

I learned how to:
* Amazon S3 can be used to host and serve static webpages.
* Configure Amazon CloudFront to enhance performance and offer safe content.
* Keep an eye on IAM policies to ensure authorized access and data security.
* Understand every step of the AWS hosting process, from setup to global distribution.
